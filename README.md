# Hash Puppies

HashPuppies is a decentralised platform built on the ethereum network. Ether is necessary to fuel transactions, which include purchasing and breeding PUPS. The platform is deployed live on the Ropsten Test Network and can be accessed at-

YoutTube-

HashPuppies is a game centered around collectible, and adorable creatures. Each pup is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by the user; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.

The platform provides collectible asset puppies that people can HODL. The puppies are NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that can be traded using Ether.
The underlying mechanism works on the Ethereum ERC-721 standard, and the pups are indivisible and unique.

The smart contracts have a number of variations (what you donâ€™t see).

**NOTE**

The website requires the Metamask wallet to be installed in the browser to be able to access the Ethreum blockchain and make transactions.

Also, I'm looking for contributors who would like to expand this project to launch in the mainstream market.

Tests for the contracts have also been written and can be found in the `test` directory.
