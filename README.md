# Hash Puppies

***HashPuppies*** is a decentralised platform built on the ethereum network. It is centered around collectible and adorable creatures (NFTs). Each pup is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by the user; it cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed. The platform provides collectible asset puppies that people can HODL. The puppies are ***NFTs*** (Non-Fungible Tokens) that can be traded using Ether.

Ether is required to fuel transactions, which include purchasing and breeding PUPS. The underlying mechanism works on the Ethereum ***ERC-721 standard***, and the pups are indivisible and unique.

The platform is makes use of the blockchain deployed live on the ***Ropsten Test Network*** and can be accessed at- https://pushpit07.github.io/HashPuppies/#/
